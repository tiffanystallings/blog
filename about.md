## About Random Ramblings

I think the title explains it all. This blog is a project of mine which exists as a way for me to learn a bit about Jekyll as well as to have a professional blog in which to discuss and showcase my work as a fledgeling web developer. I will also be uploading artwork and discussing my progress on any current projects.

## About Me

I was initially educated at the Pennsylvania Culinary Institute (which has since closed its doors) and received my AST in Culinary Arts. I worked as a cook for three years before deciding that -- while I still loved food -- I no longer loved being yelled at while preparing it.

I began working at Trader Joe's to develop new skills while spending some thought deciding what to do next. Time and time again, I returned to my love of coding and how I might turn that into a career. I thought about bioinformatics and how exciting it would be, but I didn't have the funds to jump back into a degree program and my hours weren't entirely permissive either.

I lost hope for awhile, and got comfortable with my decent wages, benefits, and positive work environment. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I was bored. I took up every intellectual responsibility offered to me, but it never felt like enough. Then, while researching computer science degrees at Georgia Tech, I came across [Udacity](http://udacity.com). Udacity has various courses available for free, but they also offer program tracks they call Nanodegrees which cost between $100 and $300 monthly. A few of those Nanodegrees carry with them a guarantee that you will get a job, or they will refund your tuition %100.

This was totally do-able for me, so I took the plunge and got started. I'm a few months into my Front End Web Development Nanodegree, and I haven't looked back since. This is my first big step into changing my career!
