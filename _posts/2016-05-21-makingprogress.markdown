This blog is slowly coming together. I probably won't make it anything too fancy as my porfolio page and resume will need work. However! This is a fantastic start.

I wanted to keep the base sass file intact as I'm not overly familiar with sass yet and I'm not quite ready to learn, so I overlaid an additional stylesheet that will hold the information for the images, sizes, and color schemes contained in this style. And -- if needed -- I can strip it back to bare bones or change styles as I get bored.

I'm thinking about browsing google fonts as well! This font is nice, but a wee bit on the boring side.
