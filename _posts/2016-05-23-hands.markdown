![Arms and hands!](http://tiffanystallings.github.io/blog/images/birdlady_02.png)

A small progress update on the status of Bird Lady -- she now has arms and hands! I might be done with her for today, but I'm happy with how far she's come.

I'm keeping her upper body largely human, while her lower body is going to have the more bird-like characteristics.

I'll be working on her feet next, which I'm quite excited about! Hooray!
