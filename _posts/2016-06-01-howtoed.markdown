**** TRIGGER WARNING!

So, this is clearly a serious post that has nothing to do with art or my professional work. Consider this more of a rant/backstory post. Still with me? Then here... we... go.

I never know what to say to people when I mention eating disorders, and I get the above phrase in response. I get it. We all have an idea of what an eating disorder does and doesn't look like.

It looks like this, right?

People have difficulty separating "Eating Disorder" from "Anorexia Nervosa". Did you know bulimics are clinically characterized as being normal weight or overweight? To be honest, I didn't know either. That was the thought that comforted me all those times I ate until I was full to bursting and ran to the bathroom to put my toothbrush down my throat.

It's okay. I'm not bulimic. I'm too fat to be bulimic. Only skinny people can have eating disorders.

When I began treatment, it was weird to admit to myself that my near daily habit of binges and purges for a few months time (and several years since I first got started) constituted a clinical diagnosis for bulimia -- that I had an eating disorder. How did this happen? How could I do something so foul and potentially deadly to myself?

Well, most eating disorder stories have a beginning. Mine began at about age five -- when I first began being told that I was fat and needed to lose weight.

I grew up with both my parents, my sister, and my grandmother. I don't consider my childhood to be all that bad. It wasn't ideal, but it wasn't the worst. I like to think my parents did the best they could, but I do still wonder.

My dad was a bipolar alcoholic who refused medication and treatment for most of the time that I knew him. He wasn't abusive, though he would often get either very angry or very sad without any notice. Sort of a confusing situation for a child to be in when her father is crying and she doesn't know why or how to make him better.

My mom clearly loved us very much, but she spent her days at work for long hours at the hospital as a nurse. When she got home, she greeted us all, ate dinner, and went off to be by herself and check out emotionally.

That left us with our grandmother as our primary caretaker. My grandmother had several jobs in her day, but the one she took the most pride in was her job as a runway model in New York City. She would talk about the way they would practice how to walk, the exercises they would do, the pills they would take to lose weight. She was the first person I remember telling me I was fat.

She had creative ways of making sure I didn't forget that fact. From small backhanded compliments like "You'd be such a knockout if you lost the weight," to suggestions like "Look how slim she looks," to more direct measures. She called me to dinner one day and as I went to the fridge to get a drink she took me aside and said that she'd talked with my parents. That they were going to take me to have my jaw wired shut so I could only eat through a straw. I was eight. When I started to cry, she said she was only joking and walked away.

My sister and I were raised to believe that looks were paramount, and we couldn't be beautiful unless we were skinny. What else were we supposed to believe?

I first learned about bulimia and anorexia in health class when I was in high school. I remember some of the girls scrunching their faces up in disgust when purging was mentioned. "Ugh, I could never do that. I hate throwing up," they said. I contemplated it myself. I'd been sick to my stomach before, but the act of vomiting always felt cleansing.

I don't remember when I first tried it. I think I was around fifteen. I just remember thinking that it wasn't so bad. From that point on I would do it whenever I ate so much that I felt sick, which didn't happen that often.

I don't remember purging when I went to culinary school, but it came back to visit me when I was nineteen and had moved in with my first boyfriend. He was aware of my occasional habit of eating until I was sickeningly full and running to the bathroom to puke, but he thought nothing of it. I was good at hiding it most of the time, though. He was the first person to tell me I didn't have an eating disorder. I wonder if he would have thought differently if he knew how often I'd binge-ate and purged after he'd gone to bed. Maybe he also thought I was too fat to have an eating disorder. I have no idea.

When we broke up after seven years together, I felt free. I didn't have to hide it anymore. I started to binge bi-weekly, then weekly, then nearly every day, and sometimes multiple times in one day. I even started binge-eating the snacks in the breakroom at work when no one else was there. I'd eat most of a coffee cake or pack of cupcakes in one sitting and run to the bathroom to puke. Ironically, my boss was to be the next person to tell me I didn't have an eating disorder.

It took a year and several people telling me that I needed help before I realized how sick I was and finally sought therapy to aid in starting recovery.

I'm not proud of my story. I'm not all the way better yet, and I still feel disgusted that I did this to myself. I'm only writing because I feel very strongly about the eating disorder community. I feel it's important to know you can't just look at a person and tell by their body how sick they are.

Binge Eating Disorder sufferers, EDNOS (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) sufferers, bulimics, and even many anorexics (particularly those early in their illness) might look perfectly normal to you. They might not look like skin stretched over bones. They might even be morbidly obese. But that doesn't make them any less sick. We all suffer in our own way.

Please don't aid our denial by telling us we don't have a problem. If someone feels close enough to you to tell you that they think they have an eating disorder, support them. Hug them. Ask them to elaborate. Ask them if you can help. You might just make a difference.
