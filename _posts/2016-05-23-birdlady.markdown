![The beginnings of Bird Lady](../images/birdlady_01.png)

Okay, so Bird Lady is just a working title.

She was inspired by my first time playing [Stellaris](http://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/) as an Avian race.

So, I've had a long running theme with games. I have always -- ALWAYS -- played the female characters. I think maybe it made me feel empowered as a female to see the lady heroes kicking ass and taking names just as much as the male ones. Honestly, I have no idea. But to this day when I play games, I will play as a female character if one is available.

Flash forward to my boyfriend letting me try Stellaris on his Steam account. There I am making my bird people and, naturally, their world leader is a lady. I was a little disappointed when the females were identical to the males in all but the human races.

Now, this is not a criticism of Paradox. They have opted to remain true to biology. Many (if not most) games sexualize and anthropomorphize their females in alternate races, but they took the higher route. Their game is about the race as a whole and its intergallactic triumph -- not about individual sexy little sprites flouncing about scantily clad.

Problem is... I like those sexy little sprites and their scantily clad-ness. I wanted an anthropomorphic bird lady. So I decided to make my own.
